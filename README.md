# üß† NLP Sentiment Analysis ‚Äî Phase 4 Group 2 Project

This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. We used various preprocessing techniques and machine learning models to classify tweets as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.

## üîç Problem Statement

Given a dataset of tweets labeled by sentiment, our task was to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.

## üíº Project Pipeline

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing text
   - Removing URLs, hashtags, digits, and punctuation
   - Dropping missing data

2. **Tokenization**
   - Splitting text into words using `nltk.word_tokenize`

3. **Stopword Removal**
   - Removing common words (e.g., "the", "is", "in") using NLTK

4. **Stemming & Lemmatization**
   - Using `PorterStemmer` and `WordNetLemmatizer` to normalize words

5. **Vectorization**
   - Converting words to numeric features using `CountVectorizer`

6. **Modeling**
   - Trained and evaluated:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Multinomial Naive Bayes
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Used `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV` to tune hyperparameters

7. **Evaluation**
   - Achieved 89% accuracy with Logistic Regression
   - Saved final model with `joblib`
